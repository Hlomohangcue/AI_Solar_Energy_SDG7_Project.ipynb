SDG 7: SOLAR ENERGY POTENTIAL PREDICTION
Machine Learning for Affordable and Clean Energy

PROBLEM ADDRESSED:
Predicting solar energy generation potential is crucial for optimal solar panel 
deployment and grid management. This project uses weather data to forecast solar 
irradiance, enabling data-driven decisions for clean energy infrastructure.

MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH:
• Type: Supervised Learning (Regression)
• Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
• Best Model: Random Forest (Tuned) with Grid Search optimization
• Features: Temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, pressure, time features
• Advanced Feature Engineering: Cyclical encoding, interaction terms, season indicators

DATASET:
• Size: 2000 samples with 13 features
• Target: Solar Irradiance (W/m²)
• Preprocessing: Missing value imputation, standardization, 80-20 train-test split

KEY RESULTS:
• Best Model MAE: 14.50 W/m² (±25.5% error)
• R² Score: 0.9327 (explains 93.3% of variance)
• Most Important Factor: solar_elevation_proxy (0.853)
• Energy Potential: 155.95 kWh/year per panel
• CO₂ Reduction: 62.38 kg/year per panel

BUSINESS IMPACT:
• Optimal deployment in low cloud cover areas during summer months (June-August)
• Peak production hours: 10 AM - 3 PM
• Annual cost savings: $18.71 per panel
• Enables predictive maintenance and energy storage optimization

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Geographic Bias: Model trained on limited climate zones - requires diverse data
2. Energy Equity: Predictions should support equitable solar access in underserved areas
3. Data Quality: Weather monitoring infrastructure varies by region
4. Sustainability: Model promotes clean energy but solar manufacturing has environmental costs
5. Transparency: Feature importance ensures interpretable decision-making

SDG ALIGNMENT:
• SDG 7 (Clean Energy): Direct support for renewable energy deployment
• SDG 13 (Climate Action): Reduces fossil fuel dependence
• SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities): Enables distributed energy systems

TECHNICAL STACK:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

CONCLUSION:
This ML model achieves 93.3% prediction accuracy, enabling optimized solar 
panel deployment and contributing to global clean energy goals. By identifying key 
weather factors, it supports data-driven decisions that maximize renewable energy 
generation while addressing ethical considerations of equitable access.
